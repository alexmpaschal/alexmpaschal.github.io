I'm a third-year mathematics student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I research dynamical systems (in particular, thermodynamic formalism) under Professor Daniel Thompson. I'm currently abroad at École normale supérieure de Lyon, studying PDE in their [MA2 program](http://mathematiques.ens-lyon.fr/parcours-2025-2026-396607.kjsp?RH=1702642109901&RF=1733132107231) on an SFRI MathInfi scholarship. My Erdős number is 3.
