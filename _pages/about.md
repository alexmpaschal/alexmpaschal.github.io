I'm a rising third-year mathematics student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I research dynamical systems (in particular, thermodynamic formalism) under Dr. Daniel Thompson. Next year I'll be abroad at École normale supérieure de Lyon, studying PDE in their [MA2 program](http://mathematiques.ens-lyon.fr/parcours-2025-2026-396607.kjsp?RH=1702642109901&RF=1733132107231) on an SFRI MathInfi scholarship.
