I'm a second-year mathematics student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the current president of the [Carolina Math Club](https://heellife.unc.edu/organization/carolinamathclub). I research analytic number theory under Dr. Idris Assani and thermodynamic formalism under Dr. Daniel Thompson. I recently gave two talks on GÃ¶del's first incompleteness theorem and wrote notes which are available [here](https://alexpasch.al/files/logic-notes.pdf).
