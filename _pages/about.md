I'm a rising third-year mathematics student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the current president of the [Carolina Math Club](https://heellife.unc.edu/organization/carolinamathclub). I research dynamical systems (in particular, thermodynamic formalism) under Dr. Daniel Thompson. Next year I'll be abroad at École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, studying PDEs in their [MA2 program](http://mathematiques.ens-lyon.fr/parcours-2025-2026-396607.kjsp?RH=1702642109901&RF=1733132107231) on an SFRI MathInfi scholarship.
