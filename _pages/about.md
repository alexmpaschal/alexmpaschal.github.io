I'm a second-year mathematics student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the current president of the [Carolina Math Club](https://heellife.unc.edu/organization/carolinamathclub). I research analytic number theory under Dr. Idris Assani and dynamical systems (in particular, thermodynamic formalism) under Dr. Daniel Thompson. Next year I'll be abroad at École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, studying PDEs in their [MA2 program](http://mathematiques.ens-lyon.fr/parcours-2025-2026-396607.kjsp?RH=1702642109901&RF=1733132107231) on an SFRI MathInfi scholarship.

I recently gave two talks on Gödel's first incompleteness theorem and wrote notes which are available [here](https://alexpasch.al/files/logic-notes.pdf).
