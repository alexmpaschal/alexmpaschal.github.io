I'm a second-year mathematics student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I'm the current president of the [Carolina Math Club](https://heellife.unc.edu/organization/carolinamathclub). I research analytic number theory under Dr. Idris Assani and thermodynamic formalism under Dr. Daniel Thompson.
