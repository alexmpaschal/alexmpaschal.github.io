Abstract: We define superabundant numbers following a discussion of the sum of divisors function. We discuss the role of superabundant numbers in equivalent statements to the Riemann hypothesis such as Robin's inequality and the Lagarias inequality, algorithms for computing superabundant numbers, and related open problems.
