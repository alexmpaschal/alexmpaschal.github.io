Abstract: We motivate and introduce symbolic dynamics. In particular, we discuss use cases for countable state symbolic dynamics and present a new infinite class of examples for which you can perform Gurevich entropy calculations. By the end of the talk I hope to elucidate the title of my REU paper: "The Variational Principle for Entropy of Countable State Shift Spaces with Specification."
