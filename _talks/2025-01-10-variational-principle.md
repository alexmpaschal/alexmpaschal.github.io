We define and discuss specification properties for countable state shift spaces, which are special cases of definitions from an upcoming paper by Climenhaga, Thompson, and Wang and generalize the well-studied compact specification property to non-compact shift spaces. We present an infinite class of examples of such shift spaces and prove the variational principle for these spaces. This gives the foundations for developing the theory of equilibrium states in this new setting.
