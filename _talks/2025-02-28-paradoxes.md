Abstract: We discuss Russell's paradox, the liar paradox, and Richard's paradox, as well as their philosophical and mathematical implications. This motivates a careful definition of logical systems and Peano arithmetic, which sets us up to prove GÃ¶del's first incompleteness theorem. If time permits, we'll also cover computability - specifically the halting problem.
